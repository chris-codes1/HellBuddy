8. Change the stratagems by clicking on them
9. Change the hotkeys by clicking on them and pressing the new keybind

# Optimization

HellBuddy was made using the Qt framework in C++, and was designed to be lightweight and use as little system resources as possible. It will use very little memory and CPU, and shouldn't effect your FPS at all.
