# HellBuddy
HellBuddy is a macro software for the game HELLDIVERS 2 that inputs stratagems for you at the press of a button.

<img src="preview.PNG" alt="HellBuddy Preview" width="177" height="395">

HellBuddy includes a minimalist GUI, where stratagem macros and their respective keybinds can be easily rebound in just a few clicks. This allows you to change your setup to match your stratagem loadout on the fly with very few clicks required. HellBuddy is currently only compatible with Windows.

# Optimization

HellBuddy was made using the Qt framework in C++, and was designed to be lightweight and use as little system resources as possible. It will use very little memory and CPU, and shouldn't effect your FPS at all.
